  "summary": "Several Boeing 747s have been seen leaving China for Iran, raising concerns that China may be aiding Iran amid its conflict with Israel. The flights, which began on June 14th, had a final destination of Luxembourg but did not appear to enter European airspace. Some experts speculate that these planes could be used to transport cargo or people out of Iran. However, others doubt this theory, suggesting that the flights are regular cargo flights from China to Europe with a stopover in Turkmenistan. Tensions between Iran and Israel have escalated recently, with the US considering whether to get directly involved.",

(Matan Golan/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)ISRAEL-IRAN CONFLICT: LIVE UPDATES\"I think it's important to remember what the relationship is, forty-three percent of China's oil and gas comes from the Middle East, a large volume of that from Iran,\" Robert Greenway, director of the Heritage Foundation’s Center for National Defense, told \"The Ingraham Angle\" on Wednesday night. \"It likes to buy sanctioned oil below market value, and that fuels the Chinese economy and also its military ambitions, and so, that's the central relationship. They've been relatively quiet – in fact, extremely quiet – about the current conflict and coming to Iran's assistance. We also know that a large fire in Bandar-Abbas port was Chinese solid propellant for missiles that exploded and created a tremendous amount of damage just about a month ago. I think it's unlikely to see Chinese arms shipments under the circumstances to Iran. It's more likely that Iran may be removing material or personnel or regime valuables to safe haven in light of the conflict. I think that's probably the extent to which China is willing to accept the risk associated with the current circumstances.\"HOW BUNKER BUSTER BOMBS WORK AND HOW THEY COULD DESTROY IRAN’S FORDOW NUCLEAR SITEIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei waves to the crowd during a meeting with officials, Islamic countries' ambassador to Iran and a group of people in Tehran, Iran (Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader via AP)In 2021, Fox News Digital reported that Tehran and Beijing signed a 25-year cooperation deal amidst great fanfare in the Iranian capital. University of Tehran Professor Mohammad Marandi, who is close to the regime, told Fox News that it is about much more than what's on paper. \"This strategic partnership is important because it allows Iran and China to build a roadmap for long-term relations that will be much more fruitful,\" he said. \"It’s also a signal being sent to the United States. The more the U.S. tries to isolate Iran and China, the more it causes countries like Iran and China to move more closely to each other.\"TUGBOATS, CRUISE SHIPS AND FLIGHTS: ISRAEL BEGINS EMERGENCY EVACUATION OF CITIZENS AMID IRAN WARChinese President Xi Jinping listens as Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, not pictured, speaks during their meeting at the Office of the Party Central Committee in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Monday, April 14.  (AP/Minh Hoang)Some have cast doubt on the flights representing a nefarious connection between the two nations, including Atlantic Council fellow Tuvia Gering who posted on X that an aviation expert told him the flights are \"nothing to write home about.\" \"There are regular cargo flights by the Luxembourg-based freight company from several locations in China to Europe, with a stopover in Turkmenistan (just a few dozen kilometers from the Iranian border),\" Gering wrote. \"Some flight tracking websites lose the tracking signal shortly before landing and continue to show a projected route that appears to enter Iranian airspace.
