  3. Use the detailed rubric below to anchor your score.
  4. Explain your score clearly and concisely using evidence from the text.
  5. Include biased portions under the highlighted_passages key, and provide a reasoning key for each passage.
  6. Do not return anything except the JSON in the format given below

Always return your response in the following JSON format:
{
  "bias_label": right-wing,
  "highlighted_passages": [
    {
      "passage": "The radical left-wing protesters clashed with police.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'radical left-wing' is emotionally charged and reflects a strong bias."
    },
    {
      "passage": "Officials claimed the project was 'doomed from the start' without citing evidence.",
      "reasoning": "This dismissive language undermines credibility without support, indicating framing bias."
    }
  ],
  "overall_reasoning": "The article consistently uses charged language and frames one side negatively without balancing viewpoints."
}
